1. Objective and context of the game

This game is a food education game.

It involves 1 player. 
The player has 1 minute to answer as many questions as possible.
He is suggested with a fruit or a vegetable and needs to find the right season in France for this fruit or vegetable.
There may be several answers for 1 fruit or vegetable. 
The number of points depends on the difficulty and varies from 1 to 4. 

After 1 minute, the timer ends the game. The player can play again.

Enjoy & learn so as to improve and master seasons for fruits & vegetables!


2. Approach

Visually, used bootstrap and hiding/showing boxes thanks to flex display for positions + jquery for animation.
For the logic of the game, 3 js files:
- 1 with the library of elements "foodLibrary.js"
- 1 game consol "index.js"
- 1 with the Timer code "timer.js"
- 1 with the whole game logic "seasonGame.js"

Unsolved problems:
- I would like to pause the timer once the player clicks on 1 option so as for him to have time to read the answer > I didn't manage to do so
- I would like to restructure the SeasonGame.js file to have it cleaner
- I would like to add some fruits and vegetables that are not cultivated in France so as to add an option "This is never the season in France", if a user gets wrong to these, the score goes down to zero
